# Color Compare Web Application Requirements

## Overview

Develop a responsive web application for visually comparing colors. The application will allow users to dynamically add or remove columns and rows of color swatches, input and select colors in various formats, and ensure optimal readability and usability across devices.

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Layout & Grid

- The main interface is a grid of color swatches that fills the entire viewport (100% width and height).
- The grid starts as a single column and a single row (1x1).
- Users can add or remove both columns and rows using a single combined +/- control for each dimension:
  - Provide one “Cols ±” control and one “Rows ±” control.
  - Click adds; Shift/Alt + Click removes.
  - The grid must always have at least one column and at least one row.
  - All columns resize automatically to share the available width equally.
  - All rows within a column resize automatically to share the available height equally.
- The grid should be implemented using responsive CSS (e.g., Bootstrap grid/flexbox).

### 2. Color Swatch (Grid Cell) Functionality

Each grid cell (color swatch) must include:

- **Background Color:** Displays the currently selected color.
- **Text Input:**
    - Allows entry of any valid CSS color value (e.g., named colors, hex, rgb(), hsl()).
    - Updates the swatch background color in real time as the user types.
    - Invalid color values should be visually indicated (e.g., red border or error message).
- **Color Picker:**
    - An icon or button inside the cell opens a pop-up color picker (native `<input type="color">` or a JS library).
    - Selecting a color updates both the text input and the swatch background.
    - The color picker should close automatically after selection.
- **Contrast Handling:**
    - Text and controls inside each cell must automatically switch between light and dark themes (e.g., black or white text) to maintain high contrast and readability against the background color.
    - Use a standard contrast algorithm (e.g., WCAG contrast ratio or luminance threshold).

### 3. User Experience & Styling

- The application must be fully responsive:
    - Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
    - Swatches and controls resize and rearrange appropriately for different screen sizes.
- Use Bootstrap for layout and styling, but custom styles may be added for improved usability.
- Controls (buttons, inputs, color picker) must be touch-friendly and accessible.
- Replace separate Add and Remove controls with a single compact +/- button for each dimension:
    - Button label shows “Cols ±” and “Rows ±”.
    - Tooltip or hint: “Click: add | Shift/Alt+Click: remove”.
- Provide visual feedback for user actions (e.g., button hover/focus states, input validation).

### 4. Accessibility

- All interactive elements must be keyboard accessible (tab navigation, enter/space activation).
- Provide appropriate ARIA labels and roles for screen readers.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for all UI elements.
- For the combined +/- buttons, ensure accessible descriptions communicate the add/remove gestures.

### 5. Optional Enhancements

- Allow users to copy the color value to clipboard with a single click.
- Display the color value in multiple formats (e.g., show hex, rgb, hsl equivalents).
- Allow users to reset a swatch to a default color.
- Persist the grid state (number of columns, rows, and colors) in local storage so the layout is restored on reload.

## Technical Requirements

- Use HTML5, Bootstrap (latest stable), and vanilla JavaScript or a lightweight JS framework if needed.
- Use a color picker library if native input is insufficient for UX.
- The application must not require a backend; all functionality is client-side.
- Code must be modular and maintainable.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- Fast load time and smooth UI interactions.
- Cross-browser compatibility (latest Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Use a single file for each type of file (html, css, js, etc).

## Deliverables

- Complete source code (HTML, CSS, JS).
- `requirements.md` (this document).
- Instructions for running locally.
