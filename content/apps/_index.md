# Web Applications

Welcome to my collection of web applications! These are interactive tools and demos that showcase various programming concepts, technologies, and solutions to real-world problems. Each application is built with modern web technologies and demonstrates different aspects of front-end development.

All applications maintain the same header, footer, and navigation as the main site for a consistent user experience, while being self-contained and fully functional.
