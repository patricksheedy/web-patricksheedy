# Calendar Print Requirements
- Build a full-screen calendar print generator that follows the established app structure and uses Bootstrap 5.
- Provide user controls for months per page (1-5), start month (default current), end month (default current), and week start day with Sunday preselected.
- Validate inputs, block invalid ranges, and give inline feedback without reloading the page.
- Generate a downloadable multi-month PDF entirely in the browser using the jsPDF CDN bundle.
- Lay out months according to the selected months-per-page option with clear typography and grid lines.
- Support every day of the week as a potential starting column for the calendar layout.
- Include accessible labels, focus management, and status updates for screen readers.
- Ensure the interface is responsive, performant, and visually polished on all screen sizes.
- Add SEO-friendly metadata and descriptive content tailored for printable calendars.
- Respect repository guidelines: no inline code comments, no extra documentation beyond this file, use popular libraries instead of custom tooling.
