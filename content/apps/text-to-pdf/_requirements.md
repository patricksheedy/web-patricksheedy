# Text to PDF Requirements
- Build a full-screen text to PDF converter that matches the existing app layout and uses Bootstrap 5.
- Provide a large text area where users can paste or type content, supporting at least 10,000 characters.
- Include a Download PDF button that exports the text as a PDF using the jsPDF CDN bundle.
- Enable simple formatting options: document title input, page orientation (portrait or landscape), and font size selection.
- Validate inputs and show inline feedback without reloading the page.
- Ensure the generated PDF keeps margins consistent and wraps text cleanly across multiple pages.
- Offer quick status updates (ready, generating, success, error) for accessibility.
- Maintain responsive design, optimized for desktop and mobile editing experiences.
- Respect repository rules: no inline comments in code, no extra documentation beyond this requirements file.
